        Chinese herbs are a fundamental component of Traditional Chinese
        Medicine (TCM), which has been practiced for thousands of years. These
        herbs are derived from natural sources, including plants, minerals, and
        sometimes animal products, and are used to restore balance within the
        body, promote health, and treat various ailments. The philosophy behind
        Chinese herbal medicine is rooted in the belief that each herb possesses
        specific qualities that can influence the body's energy (Qi), balance
        Yin and Yang, and harmonize the functions of the organs.

      <span slot="how1">
        Chinese herbs work by addressing the root cause of illness rather than
        just alleviating symptoms. Each herb is carefully selected for its
        unique properties and its ability to interact with other herbs in a
        formula. A typical Chinese herbal formula may contain several different
        herbs, each contributing to the overall therapeutic effect. These
        formulas are customized to meet the specific needs of the individual,
        taking into account their unique constitution, symptoms, and overall
        health condition.
      </span>
      <span slot="how2">
        In TCM, herbs are categorized according to their nature (hot, warm,
        cool, cold), taste (bitter, sweet, sour, salty, pungent), and their
        affinity to certain organs and meridians. By combining these factors,
        practitioners create balanced formulas that can treat a wide range of
        conditions, promote healing, and maintain health.

      <span slot="treat">
        Chinese herbs are used to treat a vast array of health conditions,
