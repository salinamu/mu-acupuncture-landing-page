      <span slot="what"
        >Acupuncture is an ancient healing practice that originates from
        Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It involves the insertion of very
        thin needles through a person's skin at specific points on the body,
        known as acupoints. The goal of acupuncture is to balance the body's
        energy, or "Qi" (pronounced "chee"), and to promote natural healing.
        This technique has been used for thousands of years to treat various
        ailments and to maintain overall well-being.

      <span slot="how1"
        >The underlying principle of acupuncture is based on the concept of Qi,
        which is believed to flow through pathways or meridians in the body.
        When the flow of Qi is blocked or unbalanced, it can lead to pain,
        illness, or other health issues. Acupuncture aims to restore the proper
        flow of Qi by stimulating specific acupoints, thereby helping the body
        return to its natural state of balance.

      <span slot="how2"
        >Modern science suggests that acupuncture may work by stimulating
        nerves, muscles, and connective tissues, which can boost the body's
        natural painkillers and increase blood flow. Research has shown that
        acupuncture can affect various biological systems, including the
        nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems, contributing to its
        therapeutic effects.
