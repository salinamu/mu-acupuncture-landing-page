      <span slot="what">
        Tuina (pronounced "twee-nah") is a form of Chinese therapeutic massage
        that is one of the fundamental treatment methods in Traditional Chinese
        Medicine (TCM). Tuina involves the use of various massage techniques to
        stimulate acupoints, meridians, and muscles, aiming to balance the
        body's Qi (energy) and promote natural healing. Unlike Western massage,
        which primarily focuses on relaxation, Tuina is a more dynamic and
        therapeutic approach that addresses specific health issues.

      <span slot="how1">
        Tuina is based on the same principles as acupuncture, focusing on the
        flow of Qi through the body's meridians. Practitioners use their hands,
        fingers, elbows, and sometimes even knees to apply pressure, knead,
        roll, and rub the body, targeting specific acupoints and areas of
        tension. The techniques used in Tuina can vary from gentle and soothing
        to deep and invigorating, depending on the condition being treated.
      </span>
      <span slot="how2">
        Tuina works by manipulating the soft tissues, muscles, and joints,
        helping to remove blockages and restore the smooth flow of Qi and blood.
        This stimulation of the bodyâ€™s energy pathways can alleviate pain,
        reduce stress, improve circulation, and enhance overall well-being.
      </span>
      <span slot="treat">
        Tuina is used to treat a wide range of conditions, both acute and
        chronic. Some of the most common conditions treated with Tuina include:
