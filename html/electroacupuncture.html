        Electroacupuncture is a modern variation of traditional acupuncture that
        involves the application of a small electrical current to the needles
        inserted into specific acupoints on the body. This technique is used to
        enhance the effects of standard acupuncture by providing continuous and
        controlled stimulation to the targeted areas. Electroacupuncture is
        commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and is often
        recommended for conditions that require a more intensive or sustained
        therapeutic approach.

      <span slot="how1">
        In an electroacupuncture session, after the needles are inserted into
        the acupoints, they are connected to a device that generates electrical
        impulses. These impulses are transmitted through the needles and into
        the body, creating a mild and adjustable electrical current that can be
        tuned for frequency and intensity based on the patient's needs and
        comfort level.
      </span>
      <span slot="how2">
        The electrical stimulation in electroacupuncture is believed to enhance
        the flow of Qi and blood in the body more effectively than manual
        manipulation alone. It also stimulates the nervous system, which can
        help modulate pain, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. The
        technique is particularly beneficial for treating conditions that
        involve chronic pain, muscle spasms, and nerve damage.

        Electroacupuncture is used to treat a variety of conditions, especially
        those related to pain and neurological issues. Some of the most common
