      <span slot="what">
        Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy that involves the
        burning of a herb called "moxa" (usually made from dried mugwort) near
        or on the body's acupuncture points. The purpose of moxibustion is to
        warm the meridians, stimulate the flow of Qi (energy), and dispel cold
        and dampness from the body. This therapy has been used for thousands of
        years, often in conjunction with acupuncture, to treat various ailments
        and to promote overall health and well-being.

        In moxibustion, moxa can be used in different forms, such as loose moxa,
        moxa sticks, or moxa cones. The moxa is lit, and the heat generated is
        directed toward specific acupuncture points on the body. There are two
        primary types of moxibustion:

      <span slot="how2">
        The heat from the burning moxa is believed to penetrate deep into the
        body, helping to invigorate the flow of Qi and blood, strengthen the
        immune system, and provide relief from pain and other symptoms.
        Moxibustion is particularly effective in treating conditions that are
        characterized by cold or deficient Yang energy in the body.
