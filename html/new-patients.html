              ><span slot="answer"
                >The most common form of acupuncture uses thin needles to
                stimulate and enhance the body’s natural healing processes.
                Traditionally, acupuncture is also believed to balance the
                energy flow (Qi) through the body.

              ><span slot="answer"
                >Most patients experience little or no pain from acupuncture,
                though a slight pinch or tingling sensation is normal. The
                needles we use are much thinner than those used for injections
                in Western medicine, making them much more comfortable.

              ><span slot="answer"
                >Acupuncture can treat many conditions, including chronic pain,
                mental health disorders, and women's health issues. If you have
                a specific health concern, call us to see if acupuncture might
                be a viable option for you.

              ><span slot="answer"
                >The number of treatments you'll need depends on various
                factors. Because each person responds differently to treatment,
                we believe it is counterproductive to tell patients a fixed
                number of treatments for full recovery.

              ><span slot="answer"
                >Insurance coverage for acupuncture varies depending on your
                provider and specific plan. Some insurance companies cover
                acupuncture while others only cover it for treating certain
                conditions. Reach out to us, and we’ll be happy to assist you in
                determining your coverage.
