      <span slot="what">
        Auriculotherapy, also known as ear acupuncture or auricular acupuncture,
        is a specialized form of acupuncture that focuses on the stimulation of
        specific points on the ear. This therapy is based on the idea that the
        ear is a microsystem that reflects the entire body, meaning that various
        points on the ear correspond to different organs, systems, and functions
        within the body. Auriculotherapy is used to promote healing and
        alleviate a wide range of health conditions by stimulating these ear
        points.

      <span slot="how1">
        Auriculotherapy works by stimulating specific points on the outer ear,
        which are believed to be connected to various parts of the body through
        the nervous system. Practitioners use a variety of techniques to
        stimulate these points, including the insertion of fine needles, the
        application of small seeds or magnets, or the use of laser or electrical
        stimulation.
      </span>
      <span slot="how2">
        The underlying principle of auriculotherapy is similar to that of
        reflexology, where specific areas of the body are believed to be
        reflected in certain parts of the ear. By stimulating these points, the
        body's natural healing processes are activated, helping to restore
        balance and alleviate symptoms.
