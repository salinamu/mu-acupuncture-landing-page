      <span slot="what"
        >Cupping is an ancient therapeutic practice that is a part of
        Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), dating back thousands of years. It
        involves placing cups on the skin to create suction, which is believed
        to promote healing through the movement of Qi (energy) and blood within
        the body. The suction created by the cups draws the skin and underlying
        tissue into the cup, helping to stimulate blood flow, ease muscle
        tension, and promote relaxation.
      </span>
      <span slot="how1"
        >Cupping works by creating a vacuum inside the cup, which is usually
        made of glass, bamboo, or silicone. This vacuum is often achieved by
        either heating the air inside the cup or using a mechanical pump. When
        the cup is placed on the skin, the vacuum pulls the skin and superficial
        muscles into the cup.
      </span>
      <span slot="how2"
        >The suction effect of cupping is believed to help remove stagnation and
        promote the free flow of Qi and blood in the body. It also helps in
        releasing toxins, improving circulation, and reducing inflammation. The
        treatment can leave round marks or bruises on the skin, which are
        typically painless and fade within a few days.
      </span>
      <span slot="treat"
        >Cupping is used to address a variety of health conditions, with a focus
        on pain relief and promoting overall wellness. Some of the common
        conditions treated with cupping include:
